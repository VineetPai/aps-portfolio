# Introduction

The first websites were simple pages of text with maybe an image or two. Today, however, anyone with a fast enough Internet connection can watch high-definition movies or make a video call over the Internet. This is possible because of a technology called streaming.

[Streaming](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/video/what-is-streaming/) is the continuous transmission of audio or video files from a server to a client. In simpler terms, streaming is what happens when consumers watch TV or listen to podcasts on Internet-connected devices. With streaming, the media file being played on the client device is stored remotely, and is transmitted a few seconds at a time over the Internet.

# Why this Portfolio?

Video streaming is becoming extreamly popular nowdays and there is no fall in watch time in near future, todays kids are getting addicted to youtube videos, shorts, tiktok, insta reels etc. All of it containing videos at core. 80% of internet by size is video content and on average [17 hours](https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/online-video-consumption-statistics) of video is streamed every week by an internet user. I personally use stream youtube videos 2-3 hours per day.
For businesses, the potential to reach consumers via online videos is high.
