## ðŸš€Introduction

The first websites were simple pages of text with maybe an image or two. Today, however, anyone with a fast enough Internet connection can watch high-definition movies or make a video call over the Internet. This is possible because of a technology called streaming.

Streaming is the continuous transmission of audio or video files from a server to a client. In simpler terms, streaming is what happens when consumers watch TV or listen to podcasts on Internet-connected devices. With streaming, the media file being played on the client device is stored remotely, and is transmitted a few seconds at a time over the Internet.[1](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/video/what-is-streaming/)
