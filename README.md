# Introduction

The first websites were simple pages of text with maybe an image or two. Today, however, anyone with a fast enough Internet connection can watch high-definition movies or make a video call over the Internet. This is possible because of a technology called streaming.

Streaming is the continuous transmission of audio or video files from a server to a client. In simpler terms, streaming is what happens when consumers watch TV or listen to podcasts on Internet-connected devices. With streaming, the media file being played on the client device is stored remotely, and is transmitted a few seconds at a time over the Internet.[1]

# Why this Portfolio?

Video streaming is becoming extreamly popular nowdays and there is no fall in watch time in near future, todays kids are getting addicted to youtube videos, shorts, tiktok, insta reels etc. All of it containing videos at core. 80% of internet by size is video content and on average 17 hours of video is streamed every week by an internet user [2]. I personally use stream youtube videos 2-3 hours per day.
For businesses, the potential to reach consumers via online videos is high.

# Objectives

To improvise functions using algorithms and data structures

# Business use cases

## 1] Loading video

For a user to watch/stream video on his favorite platform his device needs to load that video from the platforms servers where it is stored.

**Watching can be done is two ways**

- download whole video
- load in parts(streaming)

**Downloading the whole video has several disadvantages:**
- User has to wait until the entire video is downloaded.
- User cannot switch between different video quality options.
- If the user loses interest midway, the downloaded parts go unused.
- Takes up space on the user's device; some videos can be hours long and several GBs in size.
  Hence streaming is better than downloading whole video.

**Measures to make streaming better**  
**Video transcoding**  
It is the process of converting a video file from one format to another. This involves decoding the original video file into an uncompressed format and then re-encoding it into the desired format. In this process metadata like thumbnail, title, description can also be embeded.  
![Video transcoding architecture](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257879554/figure/fig2/AS:267897603883015@1440883174034/Architecture-of-video-transcoding.png)

- Benefits of video transcoding:
  - Compatibility: Ensures videos can be played on various devices and platforms by converting to supported formats.
  - Streaming Efficiency: Facilitates adaptive bitrate streaming, providing multiple quality options based on the viewer's internet connection and device capabilities.
  - Storage Optimization: Compresses video files to reduce their size, making storage more efficient and cost-effective.
  - Broad Accessibility: Makes content accessible to a wider audience by ensuring it can be viewed on different devices with varying technical specifications.
  - Content Delivery: Improves content delivery networks (CDNs) efficiency by providing optimized video formats for faster and more reliable distribution.

**Design techniques and Algorithms for Transcoding**  
**Huffman coding**  
It is an efficient method for data compression, minimizes total number of bits used to represent a set of data. It is a lossless compression technique, it creates a min-heap of characters based on there frequency in data.  
**Time Complexity:** O(nlog(n)), n=number of unique characters  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)  
[Implementation](https://github.com/Elzawawy/huffman-coding-zipper)

**H264**  
Also known as Advanced Video Coding (AVC), is a popular video compression standard used for compression and distribution of videos, it offers high compression efficiency, which reduced the bandwidth required for video streaming.  
**Encoding Complexity:** O(nlog(n)), n is number of pixels in a frame  
[Implementation](https://github.com/cisco/openh264?tab=readme-ov-file)

## 2] Use of CDNs

Content delivery networks are servers which stores the content near to users, hence reducing time required to load video. If a video resides in a server at palo alto, a CDN in mumbai will cache that video so whenever that video is accessed by any user in India, CDN will provide it.  
![CDN structure](https://blog.paessler.com/hubfs/cdn-orange.png)  
**Challenges:** finding nearest CDN

**Design techniques and Algorithms**  
**Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm**  
If a network of CDN servers was created than Dijkstra's can be employed to get shortest path between client and them.  
Technique: Greedy approach, single source shortest path.  
**Time Complexity:** O((V + E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.  
**Space Complexity:** O(V), due to the storage requirements for the distance array and the set of visited nodes.  
[Implementation](https://github.com/mburst/dijkstras-algorithm)

**A\* search**

**Time Complexity:** O(E), where E is the number of edges in the graph.  
**Space Complexity:** O(V) auxiliary space in worst case.  
[Implementation](https://github.com/EinarUeland/Astar-Algorithm)

## 3] Creating topic domains  
Topic domains are groups of related or identical videos organized into a hierarchical structure based on specific topics such as gaming, education, films, music, etc. Each domain can contain sub-domains and sub-sub-domains, creating a multi-level hierarchy.  
![graph](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Alfano/publication/329819896/figure/fig2/AS:729429030473728@1550920841314/Figure-Network-of-the-top-semantic-tags-on-NPRs-The-Two-Way-news-section-in.ppm)

- **Benefits:**
  - Targeted Changes: If the platform needs to make changes to specific videos, the hierarchical structure allows for targeted modifications within a particular domain or sub-domain.

- **Challenges:**
  - Classification accuracy
  - Handling continuous addition of new videos  

**Design techniques and Algorithms:**  
**Graphs**  
Graphs are data structures consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes, used to represent relationships between entities.  
Nodes: Represent videos.  
Edges: Represent relationships between videos.  
Hierarchical Structure: Represented using parent-child relationships within the graph.  
**Time complexity:** O(1) for adding node.  
**Space complexity:** O(V + E) where V is the number of videos (nodes) and E is the number of relationships (edges)

## 4] Playing video  
While playing videos, segments need to be dynamically loaded from servers or CDNs. Users often switch between different sections of the video, requiring an efficient method to prioritize which segments to load. Using a heap with priority can help in selecting which segments to load based on various criteria such as chapters created by the artist, most viewed sections, and segments frequently jumped to by viewers.  
![load](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3Wt03kC-34I/maxresdefault.jpg)

- **Benefits:**
  - Saving Time: Ensures quick access to important segments.

## 11] Time based stats

When a creator uploads a video, timing is one of the most important things to bother about. Videos uploaded at 3am may not get as much views as video uploaded at 8pm. Likes and comments on a video can be taken as time series data on which severals operations can be made to get valuable insights.

## 15] Handling hate speech and abuse
Videos have comments sections for user engagement and opinion sharing. But regulating these comments is very much needed to avoid hate speech and communal clashes in the society.[3]
This can be done using simple algorithms or NLP and deep learning algorithms.  
![hate](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.WBPOFMXcs3NXUWF2E1UD4wAAAA?w=225&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7)

## 16] CDN requests balancing
In scenarios where a single server must handle several thousand clients, each potentially making multiple requests, deciding the order in which to serve clients becomes crucial. Several scheduling algorithms can be employed to manage this situation effectively. Each algorithm has its advantages and is suited for different types of applications and requirements.  
![load balancing](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.kwegEO5YJg9N_G_o0RNPuQHaEA?w=334&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7)
